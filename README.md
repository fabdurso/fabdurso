I am a passionate software developer with extensive expertise in mobile app development, specializing in iOS apps since 2010 and Android apps since 2018. As an indie maker and solopreneur, I handle app development from inception to deployment on the app stores. The latest apps I've developed are OutyPlay and Noon Happen.

In addition, I have a decade of experience in QA, both manual and automation testing. For the past three years, I have led a QA team at [Crisalix](https://crisalix.com), ensuring the quality of the products and services we develop.

I am also a digital nomad who loves traveling the world while pursuing my passion for technology.
