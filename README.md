### Hello there 👋

I’m a full-stack mobile & web developer with 15+ years building fast, user-focused, high-performance apps — from concept to launch.

I ship products end-to-end (UI, backend, AI features, CI/CD).

- 📱 Mobile: React Native (cross-platform), native iOS (Swift) and Android (Kotlin)

- 🌐 Web: React + JavaScript on the frontend, Node.js + AWS Lambda on the backend

- 🤖 AI: I integrate OpenAI and other AI APIs to create smarter, dynamic experiences

- 🚚 Indie maker: I design → build → ship solo, optimizing for speed, quality and impact

### 🌍 What drives me

Travel, culture, and sports. I’ve lived in multiple countries (notably Indonesia and Spain), visited 20+ nations, and play football, basketball, beach volleyball, tennis, and padel.

These experiences shape how I build: tech that connects people in meaningful ways.
