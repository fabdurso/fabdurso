### Hello there 👋

I’m a full-stack engineer with 15+ years of experience turning ideas and manual workflows into fast, user-focused apps – from concept to launch.

I design, build, and ship products end-to-end (UI, backend, AI features, CI/CD), with a strong focus on operations, internal tools, and custom workflows.

- 📱 **Mobile**: React Native (cross-platform), native iOS (Swift) and Android (Kotlin)
- 🌐 **Web**: React + JavaScript on the frontend, Node.js + AWS Lambda on the backend
- 🤖 **AI**: OpenAI and other AI APIs for assistants, smart features, and automation
- 🚀 **Indie maker**: I design → build → ship solo, optimizing for speed, quality, and impact

### 🌍 What drives me

Travel, culture, and sports.  
I’ve lived in multiple countries (notably Indonesia and Spain), visited 20+ nations, and played everything from football and basketball to beach volleyball, tennis, and padel.

These experiences shape how I build: technology that connects people in meaningful, real-world ways.
