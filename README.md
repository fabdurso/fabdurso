I am a passionate software developer with expertise in mobile app development, QA testing, and automation testing for web. As a full stack mobile developer, I have developed a range of mobile applications that provide exceptional user experiences while maintaining the highest levels of functionality and usability.

As a QA team lead at [Crisalix](https://crisalix.com), I am responsible for ensuring the quality of the products and services we develop. I work with cross-functional teams to design and execute test plans, test cases, and test scripts. My goal is to ensure that our products meet or exceed customer expectations and are free of defects.

In addition, I am a digital nomad who loves travelling the world while pursuing my passion for technology. As a tech enthusiast, I am always on the lookout for new trends and emerging technologies that can enhance my work and the products and services I create. I believe in continuous learning and growth, and I strive to stay updated with the latest developments in the industry.

My experience as a creator of Noon Happen for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1477310602) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.noonhappen.noonhappen) has provided me with a unique perspective on mobile development, user experience, and customer satisfaction. I have leveraged my skills and knowledge to create exceptional apps that meet the needs of users and provide them with a seamless experience.
